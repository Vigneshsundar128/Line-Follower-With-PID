# Line-Follower-With-PID

The line follower robot is a popular project in the field of robotics that utilizes various components and control techniques to enable the robot to autonomously follow a line on the ground. In this summary, we will focus on a line follower robot built using an Arduino Nano, N20 motors, DRV8833 motor driver, and a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller.

The Arduino Nano is a compact and versatile microcontroller board that serves as the brain of the line follower robot. It offers a wide range of input and output pins, making it suitable for controlling motors and sensors. The N20 motors are small DC motors commonly used in robotics projects due to their compact size and adequate torque.

To control the motors, the DRV8833 motor driver is employed. The DRV8833 is a dual H-bridge motor driver capable of driving two DC motors independently. It provides bidirectional control and allows the robot to move forward, backward, and turn by controlling the motor speed and direction.

In order to achieve accurate line following, a PID controller is implemented. The PID controller continuously calculates an error value based on the difference between the desired position (center of the line) and the current position of the line follower robot. The PID controller then adjusts the motor speed and direction based on this error value to keep the robot on the line.

# The line follower robot operates as follows:

The robot is equipped with line-sensing sensors such as infrared (IR) sensors or reflective optical sensors. These sensors are positioned beneath the robot, facing the ground, to detect the contrast between the line and the surrounding surface. The sensors provide analog signals to the Arduino Nano, indicating whether the robot is on the line or off the line based on threshold value.

The Arduino Nano reads the sensor inputs and calculates the error value by determining the deviation of the robot from the desired line position.

The PID controller takes the error value as input and processes it using proportional, integral, and derivative terms to generate a control signal. The proportional term adjusts the motor speed based on the immediate error value, the integral term considers the accumulated error over time, and the derivative term accounts for the rate of change of the error.

The control signal is sent to the DRV8833 motor driver, which adjusts the motor speeds and directions accordingly. By controlling the motor speeds differentially, the robot can make smooth turns and maintain stability while following the line.

The process of reading sensor inputs, calculating the error value, and adjusting the motor speeds is repeated in a continuous feedback loop, allowing the line follower robot to dynamically adapt to changes in the line and navigate along its path.

By combining the Arduino Nano, N20 motors, DRV8833 motor driver, and PID controller, the line follower robot can accurately follow a predefined path or line on the ground. This project not only demonstrates the principles of control systems and robotics but also serves as a foundation for further exploration and enhancements in autonomous robotics applications.
